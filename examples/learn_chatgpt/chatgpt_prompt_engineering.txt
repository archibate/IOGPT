ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like conversations and text. It has numerous applications like question answering, decision making, and sentiment analysis. Several companies such as Snap Inc. and Instacart are using it to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

Developers can integrate conversational features into their products using the Chat Completion API, which offers personalized recommendations and open-ended shopping goals. ChatGPT can also be interacted with using the Chat Markup Language (ChatML).

Moreover, ChatGPT has been used recently for text data augmentation, health answer correctness, and personality assessment. There are ethical considerations and potential research opportunities in exploring the use of ChatGPT in various industries.
