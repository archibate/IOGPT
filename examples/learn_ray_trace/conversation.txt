Ray tracing is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to generate photorealistic images. It works by testing a ray of light for intersections with objects in the scene, and updating the pixel's color according to the distance the ray traveled without intersecting. Ray tracing is used in many applications, such as video games, movies, and virtual reality, and is becoming increasingly popular due to advances in hardware and software. It is computationally intensive, but can be parallelized to some degree. Microsoft and Sony have both announced their upcoming consoles, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, which will feature ray tracing technology and are set to be released in the holiday season of 2020.

Ray tracing is a 3D computer graphics technique used to produce photorealistic images. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel of a virtual screen and calculating the color of the object visible through it. Ray tracing is popular because it is based on a realistic simulation of light transport, making effects such as reflections and shadows easier to simulate. It has been around since the 1970s and is used in many applications, such as films, games, and virtual reality. The next-generation of consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, are expected to feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing capabilities. GPUs, such as AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series, will also support DXR real-time ray tracing for improved visuals.

...Ray tracing (graphics)
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.
On a spectrum of computational cost and visual fidelity, ray tracing-based rendering techniques, such as ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping and path tracing, are generally slower and higher fidelity than scanline rendering methods.[1] Thus, ray tracing was first deployed in applications where taking a relatively long time to render could be tolerated, such as still computer-generated images, and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suited to real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.[2]

Reversed direction of traversal of scene by the rays[edit]
The process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes called backwards ray tracing, since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as James Arvo used the term backwards ray tracing to mean shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results.

Ray tracing-based rendering techniques that involve sampling light over a domain generate image noise artifacts that can be addressed by tracing a very large number of rays or using denoising techniques.
History[edit]
The idea of ray tracing comes from as early as the 16th century when it was described by Albrecht Dürer, who is credited for its invention.[5] Dürer described multiple techniques for projecting 3D scenes onto an image plane. Some of these project chosen geometry onto the image place, as is done with rasterization today. Others determine what geometry is visible along a given ray, as is done with ray tracing. [6][7]
Using a computer for ray tracing to generate shaded pictures was first accomplished by Arthur Appel in 1968.[8] Appel used ray tracing for primary ...

Scenes in ray tracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist (normally using intermediary tools). Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.
Typically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming light at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.
It may at first seem counterintuitive or "backward" to send rays away from the camera, rather than into it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming major...

Although it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily photorealistic. True photorealism occurs when the rendering equation is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required.
The realism of all rendering methods can be evaluated as an approximation to the equation. Ray tracing, if it is limited to Whitted's algorithm, is not necessarily the most realistic. Methods that trace rays, but include additional technique...
... allowed computer generated imagery to be faithful to reality.
For decades, global illumination in major films using computer generated imagery was faked with additional lights. Ray tracing-based rendering eventually changed that by enabling physically-based light transport. Early feature films rendered entirely using path tracing include Monster House (2006), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009),[14] and Monsters University (2013).[15]
Algorithm overview[edit]
Optical ray tracing describes a method for producing visual images constructed in 3D computer graphics environments, with more photorealism than either ray casting or scanline rendering techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.

Ray tracing is a photorealistic rendering technique used in 3D computer graphics to generate realistic images. The technique works by tracing a path from an imaginary camera through each pixel on a virtual screen and calculating the color of the object visible through it. 

Ray tracing models interreflection and optical effects accurately, such as refraction, but may not always achieve true photorealism. Implementing the rendering equation can give true photorealism, but requires a significant amount of computing resources.

Some of the different ray tracing methods include ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping, and path tracing. These methods work differently in terms of computational cost and visual fidelity.

Ray tracing technology was first deployed in non-real-time applications such as still computer-generated images and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suitable for real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.

However, since 2019, hardware acceleration for real-time ray tracing has become standard, enabling its application in real-time rendering for video games.

Ray tracing is used in many applications, including films, video games, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). The use of ray tracing allows for the creation of high-quality 3D graphics, and has revolutionized the realism of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in film and games.

Overall, ray tracing is an important technique used in the field of computer graphics for producing realistic and high-quality images. Its continuing development and implementation enable new possibilities in the visual expression of digital media.
