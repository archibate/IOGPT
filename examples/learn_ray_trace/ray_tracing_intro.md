Ray tracing is a photorealistic rendering technique used in 3D computer graphics to generate realistic images. The technique works by tracing a path from an imaginary camera through each pixel on a virtual screen and calculating the color of the object visible through it.

Ray tracing models interreflection and optical effects accurately, such as refraction, but may not always achieve true photorealism. Implementing the rendering equation can give true photorealism, but requires a significant amount of computing resources.

Some of the different ray tracing methods include ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping, and path tracing. These methods work differently in terms of computational cost and visual fidelity.

Ray tracing technology was first deployed in non-real-time applications such as still computer-generated images and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suitable for real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.

However, since 2019, hardware acceleration for real-time ray tracing has become standard, enabling its application in real-time rendering for video games.

Ray tracing is used in many applications, including films, video games, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). The use of ray tracing allows for the creation of high-quality 3D graphics, and has revolutionized the realism of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in film and games.

Overall, ray tracing is an important technique used in the field of computer graphics for producing realistic and high-quality images. Its continuing development and implementation enable new possibilities in the visual expression of digital media.
