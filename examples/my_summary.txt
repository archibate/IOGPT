HTML5test is a web application developed by Dutch programmer Niels Leenheer that tests a browser's accuracy in implementing HTML5 standards. The test returns an integer score out of a possible 555 points, providing details about the browser's compatibility with HTML5 and recommendations for improvement. It is a useful tool for web developers and users to ensure their browser is up-to-date with the latest HTML5 standards, and Google Chrome currently has the highest score.
