ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 series and is available for free to the public. It has some limitations, such as not being aware of events after 2021 or not providing sources for its responses. However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, users can access the GPT-4 model. Compared to Bing Chat, another chatbot service also powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model, ChatGPT lacks access to the internet and does not source back to the sites it pulls information from. However, Google Bard, another chatbot released by Google, was found to be lacking in its ability to answer questions, even with access to the internet. In a comparison between ChatGPT and Google Bard, ChatGPT outperforms Google Bard, leading Google to launch a Trusted Tester program to improve its accuracy and reliability.
