ChatGPT is an AI-driven natural language processing tool available free of charge to the public. It is powered
 by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 series, and with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, users can access the GPT-4 model. It has
 some limitations, such as not being aware of events after 2021 or not providing sources for its responses. Bi
ng Chat, another chatbot service, is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model, has access to the internet, and sources 
back to the sites it pulls information from. Google Bard, another chatbot released by Google, was found to be 
lacking in its ability to answer questions, even with access to the internet. ChatGPT was found to outperform 
Google Bard, leading Google to launch a Trusted Tester program to improve its accuracy and reliability.
